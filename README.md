# README
# Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:

-- 🗺️ Explore: What are the jobs of the people most likely to subscribe to a term deposit?
-- 📊 Visualize: Create a plot to visualize the number of people subscribing to a term deposit by month.
-- 🔎 Analyze: What impact does the number of contacts performed during the last campaign have on the likelihood that a customer subscribes to a term deposit?

# Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:
-- You work for a financial services firm. The past few campaigns have not gone as well as the firm would have hoped, and they are looking for ways to optimize their marketing efforts.
-- They have supplied you with data from a previous campaign and some additional metrics such as the consumer price index and consumer confidence index. They want to know whether you can predict the likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit. The manager would also like to know what factors are most likely to increase a customer's probability of subscribing.
-- You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.
